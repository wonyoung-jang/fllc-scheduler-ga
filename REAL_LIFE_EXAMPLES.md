# Real life examples of FLLC tournaments and GA usage

## OLD: This section needs updating to the new JSON configuration, though the general idea is the same.

The `csv` and `ini` files in the `real_life_examples` directory are anonymized and normalized schedules of real FLLC tournaments. The configs are representations of how a schedule would be generated to match.

The `report.txt` files are reports generated by the `io.export.generate_summary_report` function.

## 2022-2023 example

First, here's the csv for the tournament `fllc_2022-2023/schedule.csv`:

From this, I derived a config (only showing the round section): `fllc_2022-2023/config.ini`

```

Importing and adding to the population through the CLI (I'm using PowerShell):

```bash
uv run fll_scheduler_ga `
--config_file .\real_life_examples\fllc_2022-2023\config.ini `
--import_file .\real_life_examples\fllc_2022-2023\schedule.csv `
--add_import_to_population `
--flush
```

With the current configuration, this run takes my machine 26 seconds to complete. Here is the report for the schedule in the Pareto front with the highest total fitness (only showing the aggregated parts on top):

```txt
Objective Scores:
  - BreakTime        : 0.655576
  - TableConsistency : 0.576032
  - OpponentVariety  : 1.000000

Total            : 2.231608
Average          : 0.743869

Max     : 2.235375
Min     : 1.720911

```

There is improvement from the imported schedule on almost every objective except for BreakTime.

Since the FLLC Scheduler will automatically save the best (or all) schedules, it's easy to simply run this configuration again. This time I will omit the importing and adding of the schedule, and the `--flush` command, which deletes the saved schedules from the previous run:

```bash
uv run fll_scheduler_ga `
--config_file .\real_life_examples\fllc_2022-2023\config.ini
```

Now we can see improvements in every objective, but still doesn't beat our original schedule in break time consistency:

*Run 2 (18s)*

```txt
Objective Scores:
  - BreakTime        : 0.730126
  - TableConsistency : 0.620243
  - OpponentVariety  : 1.000000

Total            : 2.350369
Average          : 0.783456

Team fitnesses (sorted by total fitness descending):

Max     : 2.461994
Min     : 1.779742
Range   : 0.682252
Average : 2.165525
```

![1024 generations Fitness over generations](/assets/2022-2023/after_1024_generations/fitness_vs_generation.png)

![1024 generations Scatter](/assets/2022-2023/after_1024_generations/pareto_scatter_3d.png)

Running it a third time gives us improvements in every objective from our original:

*Run 3 (19s)*

```txt
Objective Scores:
  - BreakTime        : 0.752177
  - TableConsistency : 0.685561

Normally, genetic algorithms and schedulers are left running for much longer than the 63 seconds of runtime we spent here, and we would have seen even better results had we done that, but I hope this shows how this program can be useful for anybody hosting an event!

Below each result are images for a plot of fitness in each objective over generations, and a scatter plot of each generated schedule. These show two things: 

1. The algorithm is converging on a "front" (indicated by the line of purple points in the scatter plot)
2. The algorithm isn't close to "fully" converging after 1536 generations

And just for fun, here is the schedule CSV for the most fit of the front from the last run:
